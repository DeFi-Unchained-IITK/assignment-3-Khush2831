The TestVoting contract is intended to test the functionality of a Voting contract placed on the Ethereum network. It imports Assert.sol for assertions and calls DeployedAddresses.sol to get the address of the deployed Voting contract. The contract uses this address to create an instance of Voting and implements a number of test methods.

These routines include testAddOption(), which tests and confirms the validity of voting options. testRegisterPerson() simulates the registration procedure of persons in the voting system. TestVote() tests the voting system by registering votes and checking tallies. Finally, testGetChampion() selects the winning choice through voting and checks the right result.
